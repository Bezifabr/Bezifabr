👋 Hi, I’m Maciej Šaranda
I'm a full-stack developer 6+ years of experience building scalable systems with Kotlin, Spring Boot, React, and cloud-native infrastructure (GCP, Kubernetes, Firebase). I enjoy solving real-world problems—from backend architecture and dev tooling to frontend UX and AI workflows.

🔧 What I work with:

Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot, Gradle
React, TypeScript, Next.js
GCP (GKE, Pub/Sub, Spanner), Firebase
Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Helm, Flux)
AI tools & LLM-based development workflows

📦 I care about clean code, maintainable architecture (DDD, modular monoliths), and well-tested systems (TDD, integration tests, test automation).
🧠 I'm currently diving deep into concurrency, distributed systems, and the practical use of AI in development.

📍 Based in Warsaw. Remote-first.
💡 Open to collaboration and always up for learning something new.
